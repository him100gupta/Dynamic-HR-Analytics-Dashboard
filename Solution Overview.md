## Solution Overview: Dynamic HR Dashboard
Using Power BI, I created a dynamic, interactive HR dashboard. The dashboard contains bookmarks and uses the selection pane to help the client navigate through the three key sections. It includes a slicer as well to have insights from specific departments.

The dashboard is divided into three parts:

1. Workflow Overview
2. Compensation and Benefits
3. Employee Development and Growth

### 1. Workflow Overview:
This section focuses on providing the client with the general overview of their workforce and attrition metrics, and it includes:

KPIs:

+ Total number of employees
+ Average age of employees
+ Average tenure of employees (in years)
+ Number of employees who left (attrition count)
+ Attrition rate (calculated as a percentage of total employees)

Charts & Visualizations:

+ Active employee percentage distribution by Job Role (Donut Chart)
+ Employee age distribution (Stacked Column Chart)
+ Gender distribution (Donut Chart)
+ Job ratings by active employees in each job role (Matrix)
+ Percentage of employee attrition by job role (Donut Chart)
+ Attrition by age, salary, and gender (Stacked Column and Donut Charts)
+ Job rating by ex-employees (Matrix)
+ Attrition by job role (Waterfall Chart)
