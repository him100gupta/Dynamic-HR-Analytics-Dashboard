## Client Overview
The client is a mid-sized company with a workforce of over 1500 employees. They needed an interactive HR dashboard to monitor employee metrics such as workforce composition, compensation, and development. The goal was to enable data-driven decisions that could optimize employee retention, satisfaction, compensation, and growth.

They requested a Power BI dashboard that would provide:
+ Detailed insights into employee demographics and attrition rates.
+ An analysis of compensation, overtime, and salary hikes.
+ Tracking of training and promotions to assess employee growth.
